#GameDesign 

Games are essentially a series of actions taken to achieve a certain goal by one or more players.
Incentives are a large part of game design, it is the core reason why a player would do anything in a game

Games are a system of incentives

In MegaMan, game ddesigner #KenjiInafune uses a simple mechanism to reward players for not mashing the shoot button, by increasing the effectiveness of the shot, the longer the player charges it.
This limits the actions of the player (spamming shots) since their right hanf would now be anchored to the shooting button
The charged shot is more risky but more reqarding as it is more powerful
